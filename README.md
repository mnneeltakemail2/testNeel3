## Main Waves Features

* [_**Fully functional exchange**_](/platform-features/decentralized-cryptocurrency-exchange-dex.md) that is as fast as a centralized one but does not suffer from the same security issues.
* [_**Smart contracts**_](/technical-details/waves-contracts-language-description.md) include account and token controls, which provide functionality to implement features such as multi-signature wallets, atomic swaps and 2-factor authorization.
* It provides the services of launching, distributing and trading crypto token \(creation, issuance, transfer, exchange of assets and custom or fiat tokens\).
* The fiat-crypto problem is solved through [_**Waves fiat gateways**_](/waves-client/wallet-management.md).
* [_**Waves-NG protocol**_](/platform-features/waves-ng-protocol.md) which greatly increases TPS capacity because miners no longer compete to verify transactions.
* [_**Leased Proof-of-Stake\(LPoS\)**_](/platform-features/leased-proof-of-stake-lpos.md) algorithm to find a distributed consensus.
