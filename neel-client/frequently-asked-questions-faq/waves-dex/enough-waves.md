# How to get enough Neel for the fees?

As you may know, Neel is the main currency of the whole Neelplatform. So, before creating an **order** or **outgoing** transfer, please make sure that you have enough **Neel**.

The fee for creating one **buy** or **sell** order on the DEX platform is **0.003 Neel**. To create any outgoing transfer from the wallet will cost you **0.001 Neel**.

If you have enough assets (BTC/ETH/LTC/ZEC/USD/EUR and so on) and if these assets have sufficient value, just exchange them for Neel without having initial Neel using the internal DEX exchange.

For more information please follow the instructions:

* [iOS: Start trading on the Neel DEX](/neel-client/mobile-apps/iOS/neel-dex/start-trading-on-the-neel-dex.md)
* [Android: Start trading on the Neel DEX](/neel-client/mobile-apps/android/neel-dex/start-trading-on-the-neel-dex.md)

**Warning** When you are exchanging assets for Neel to get the first tokens. Please take into account the amount of exchanging, since order fee is 0.003 Neel. Thus, the amount will be debited from the received Neel after order execution.
