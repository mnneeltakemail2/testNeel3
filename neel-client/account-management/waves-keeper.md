## Introduction

Waves is a secure system, but we continue to take care of safekeeping of the clients funds. So, we developed and called it **Waves Keeper** because it allows you to hold your WAVES keys securely while interacting safely with third-party web resources. It is a kind of Simple Authentication and SSO for dApps or Waves-enabled web applications and enables you to sign transactions without entering your private key or password. Your seed is held securely within the extension and cannot be accessed by outside apps, keeping your funds safe from malicious sites.

SEEDs and private keys are encrypted and stored within the extension and cannot be accessed by the dApps and services on the web, giving you peace of mind that your funds are always safe from hackers and malicious sites. Completing a transaction doesnâ€™t require entering any sensitive information.

Waves Keeper is designed for convenience, so you can sign transactions with just a couple of clicks. Users can create multiple wallets and switch between them easily, and if you ever forget the password to the account you can recover it from your SEED, as normal.
