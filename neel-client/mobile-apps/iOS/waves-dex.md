# Neel DEX

This chapter includes all details about decentralized exchange \(DEX\).

Neel provides a decentralized exchange, which allows trading different assets back and forth between users, as a traditional exchange, with stronger security guarantees to end users due to its decentralized nature. An opportunity of creating some new assets, based on Neel, allows early trading of a crowdfunding stake, that provides liquidity for tokens. For this purpose, tokens should be sold in public locations, where buyers and sellers may post orders.
