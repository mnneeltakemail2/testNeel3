## How to receive Asset

Think of the Waves account as a multi-wallet. It, obviously, supports Waves and also any other token existing on the Waves blockchain.

Whenever you want to receive Waves based asset, just hand your personal Waves address to the sender and he is able to execute the transaction.

Open your Waves wallet. At the top left corner click on the avatar of your account.
