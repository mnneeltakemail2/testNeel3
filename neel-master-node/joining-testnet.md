# Neel Testnet

Testnet is a fully functioning Neel blockchain with the one key exception that because the Neel on the network can be created freely, it has no value. Testnet helps developers test new versions of Neel, as well as test network operations using identical versions of the software before they are carried out on the mainnet.
